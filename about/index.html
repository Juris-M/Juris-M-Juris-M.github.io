              Juris-M a research environment that is based on, but
              separate from, the well-known Zotero reference manager.
              It adds support for legal materials, legal citation
              styles, and multilingual materials. Juris-M is one-of-a-kind:
              no other research support platform provides these facilities.

              Juris-M began life in 2010 the &ldquo;Multilingual
              Zotero,&rdquo; plugin (MLZ) for the Firefox
              browser. Because changes to Firefox in 2015 made
              plugin maintenance difficult and burdensome, Juris-M
              is now distributed as a standalone client <i>only</i>.

            <dt>A new moniker!</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                &ldquo;Zotero&rdquo; is a trademark of the Zotero
                project proper. The purpose of trademark is to prevent
                confusion, and both the Zotero team and I have been a
                little concerned that the &ldquo;Multilingual
                Zotero&rdquo; name suggests a tighter connection
                between the two projects than actually exists. The
                only thing shared between this project and official
                Zotero is code; no money changes hands, and the Zotero
                developers have no control over what happens at this
                end. The name change will help to make that clear.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new name is meant to reflect (a little) that the
                tool supports legal as well as multilingual
                referencing.  You can pronounce it any way that you
                like, but the obvious choices seem to be either
                <i>juris-em</i> or <i>jurism</i> (as in
                &ldquo;formalism&rdquo;). The &ldquo;j&rdquo; might be
                hard or soft, depending on your own linguistic habits.
                I favour the soft version (<i>yurism</i>), because we
                could then form a project ensemble and call it <i>The
                Juris-M-ics</i>. But I digress.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Modular legal style support</dt>
            <dd>
              Second only to the excitement of the new name is the
              introduction of modular legal style support. You can explore
              this through the &ldquo;Style Development&rdquo; area of
              this site, which provides a module-aware previewing
              editor for Juris-M and CSL styles. Legal style modules
              can be maintained independently, and called into action
              by simple template code that can be added to any CSL
              style adapted for use with Juris-M. It is an approach
              that will scale, because it cleanly separates legal
              referencing conventions from the vagaries of
              general-purpose style manuals like the <i>Bluebook</i>.

        <h3>Further developments</h3>
        <div class="multi-column">
          <p>
            There are some challenges in the offing.
          </p>
          <h3>Code review</h3>
          <p>
            The first challenge is related to the code signing
            requirement mentioned above. This will be accompanied by a
            (reputedly relatively loose) form of code review,
            conducted by Firefox contributors or staff. Loose it may
            be, but as I am an amateur coder, and as the volume of
            code that I have written for this Zotero fork is quite
            large, we cannot expect that approval will be easy or
            automatic.  It would be better to have more than one
            person involved in Juris-M coding, but unless and until
            the project has significant funding, I don&rsquo;t expect
            that to happen.
          </p>
          <h3>Sync service</h3>
          <p>
            A second issue involves sync service. Juris-M (like MLZ)
            is currently sync-compatible with official
            Zotero. However, the existing Zotero sync servers will be
            shut down a few months after the release of Zotero 5.0
            (itself due out in a few months&rsquo; time). The main
            project will then move to a new API-based sync
            architecture that is supported by the new Zotero release.
            To retain sync support, Juris-M will need to be adapted to
            the new Zotero 5.0 code base. It is a fairly massive task,
            since the patches applied by Juris-M are numerous, and the
            changes in Zotero are broad and deep. It is proving
            necessary to rewrite significant portions of Juris-M from
            scratch, and it is possible that the API-sync-compatible
            client will not be ready by the time of the shutdown. User
            data will not be at risk, but life could become less
            convenient for a time.
          </p>
          <p style="background:#eeeeee;border-radius:1.5em;padding:0.5em 1em 0.5em 1em;">
            It bears emphasis that neither of the issues above is a
            threat to project survival. Juris-M is in active use among
            students in the faculty where I hold my academic post, and
            that provides ample justification for continuing this
            work&mdash;it is in fact essential to us. Over the longer
            term, we will want to place the project on a firmer
            foundation. The coding requirements of the coming months
            are a wake-up call, and an experience that I would prefer
            not to repeat. The first step in that direction is likely to
            be a &ldquo;donate&rdquo; button, followed by efforts to
            interest funding bodies and major NGOs to support this
            work, so that we can support the world&hellip;
          </p>
          <p>
            For the present, though, welcome again to Juris-M!
