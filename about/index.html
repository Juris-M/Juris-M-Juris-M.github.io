        <div class="multi-column">
          <p style="background:#eeeeee;border-radius:1.5em;padding:0.5em 1em 0.5em 1em;">
            Followers of MLZ may have noticed recent mentions of a
            rebranding of the tool as &ldquo;Juris-M.&rdquo;
            This is its home: Welcome. I hope you like the new digs.
            This note explains the reason for the rebranding, introduces
            some of its newly added features, and peeks forward to some
            important developments on the horizon. After reading these
            notes, you can jump to the top of the site by clicking on
            the Juris-M logo at the top of the page.
          </p>
          <h3>Top of the Pops</h3>
          <p>
            Three items stand at the top of the agenda.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Juris-M is a &ldquo;new product&rdquo;</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                Firefox is on the verge of requiring that all Add-ons be
                signed by the author or institution that issues
                them. MLZ began as a (relatively) casual fork of Zotero,
                and it used the same product ID as the official
                product. That was a choice born of inexperience on my
                part, but it will soon be flat-out impermissible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Juris-M has a unique ID all its own, and can be
                distributed under the new policy. One consequence of
                the ID change, however, is that automatic upgrades
                from MLZ to Juris-M will not be possible: you will
                need to manually install Juris-M and its friends from
                the &ldquo;Research Tools&rdquo area of this site.
                After installation, upgrades will be automatic, as
                before.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Juris-M is shy and friendly</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                While Juris-M has a separate identify from Zotero, it
                would still be very confusing to have both running
                in the same browser (!). When installed together with
                official Zotero, Juris-M will present a selection at
                startup, asking which of the two you wish to use: the
                other will be automatically disabled.
              </p>
              <p>
                If Juris-M finds a Zotero (or MLZ) database at
                startup, it will make its own
                <i>separate copy</i> of the database. If you decide
                that Juris-M is not for you, you can return to your
                previous Zotero installation in three simple steps:
                (1) sync Juris-M; (2) enable official Zotero; (3) sync
                Zotero. Changes made in Juris-M &ldquo;mode&rdquo; will
                be synced down to the Zotero database.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Juris-M is <i>the</i> successor to MLZ</dt>
            <dd>
              MLZ users should plan to replace it with Juris-M, and
              soon. There are cool new features and bug-fixes in
              Juris-M already that will make your life easier; and the
              new Firefox signing policy means that distribution of
              MLZ will eventually be blocked altogether.

            <dt>A new moniker!</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                &ldquo;Zotero&rdquo; is a trademark of the Zotero
                project proper. The purpose of trademark is to prevent
                confusion, and both the Zotero team and I have been a
                little concerned that the &ldquo;Multilingual
                Zotero&rdquo; name suggests a tighter connection
                between the two projects than actually exists. The
                only thing shared between this project and official
                Zotero is code; no money changes hands, and the Zotero
                developers have no control over what happens at this
                end. The name change will help to make that clear.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new name is meant to reflect (a little) that the
                tool supports legal as well as multilingual
                referencing.  You can pronounce it any way that you
                like, but the obvious choices seem to be either
                <i>juris-em</i> or <i>jurism</i> (as in
                &ldquo;formalism&rdquo;). The &ldquo;j&rdquo; might be
                hard or soft, depending on your own linguistic habits.
                I favour the soft version (<i>yurism</i>), because we
                could then form a project ensemble and call it <i>The
                Juris-M-ics</i>. But I digress.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Modular legal style support</dt>
            <dd>
              Second only to the excitement of the new name is the
              introduction of modular legal style support. You can explore
              this through the &ldquo;Style Development&rdquo; area of
              this site, which provides a module-aware previewing
              editor for Juris-M and CSL styles. Legal style modules
              can be maintained independently, and called into action
              by simple template code that can be added to any CSL
              style adapted for use with Juris-M. It is an approach
              that will scale, because it cleanly separates legal
              referencing conventions from the vagaries of
              general-purpose style manuals like the <i>Bluebook</i>.

        <h3>Further developments</h3>
        <div class="multi-column">
          <p>
            There are some challenges in the offing.
          </p>
          <h3>Code review</h3>
          <p>
            The first challenge is related to the code signing
            requirement mentioned above. This will be accompanied by a
            (reputedly relatively loose) form of code review,
            conducted by Firefox contributors or staff. Loose it may
            be, but as I am an amateur coder, and as the volume of
            code that I have written for this Zotero fork is quite
            large, we cannot expect that approval will be easy or
            automatic.  It would be better to have more than one
            person involved in Juris-M coding, but unless and until
            the project has significant funding, I don&rsquo;t expect
            that to happen.
          </p>
          <h3>Sync service</h3>
          <p>
            A second issue involves sync service. Juris-M (like MLZ)
            is currently sync-compatible with official
            Zotero. However, the existing Zotero sync servers will be
            shut down a few months after the release of Zotero 5.0
            (itself due out in a few months&rsquo; time). The main
            project will then move to a new API-based sync
            architecture that is supported by the new Zotero release.
            To retain sync support, Juris-M will need to be adapted to
            the new Zotero 5.0 code base. It is a fairly massive task,
            since the patches applied by Juris-M are numerous, and the
            changes in Zotero are broad and deep. It is proving
            necessary to rewrite significant portions of Juris-M from
            scratch, and it is possible that the API-sync-compatible
            client will not be ready by the time of the shutdown. User
            data will not be at risk, but life could become less
            convenient for a time.
          </p>
          <p style="background:#eeeeee;border-radius:1.5em;padding:0.5em 1em 0.5em 1em;">
            It bears emphasis that neither of the issues above is a
            threat to project survival. Juris-M is in active use among
            students in the faculty where I hold my academic post, and
            that provides ample justification for continuing this
            work&mdash;it is in fact essential to us. Over the longer
            term, we will want to place the project on a firmer
            foundation. The coding requirements of the coming months
            are a wake-up call, and an experience that I would prefer
            not to repeat. The first step in that direction is likely to
            be a &ldquo;donate&rdquo; button, followed by efforts to
            interest funding bodies and major NGOs to support this
            work, so that we can support the world&hellip;
          </p>
          <p>
            For the present, though, welcome again to Juris-M!
