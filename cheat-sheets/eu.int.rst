Juris-M: European Union
=======================

This guide applies to Juris-M items set to the ``EU.INT``
jurisdiction. It covers the top tier of European
institutions (currently only cases of the European Commission).

In production with Juris-M, use the ``Abbreviation Filter`` to
transform or suppress jurisdiction names as appropriate.

Citation Forms

In the input guidance below, required fields are set in **boldface**;
entries set in *italics* are optional.

Case

[Reported cases]
    Required fields: **Case Name**, **Docket Number**, **Court**,
    **Call Number**, **Date Decided**, **Reporter**, **Issue**,
    **First Page**, and **Jurisdiction**.

    Notes:

    **Case Name:** The full name of the case to be shown in citations.
    Enter both parties, connected by ``v.`` as appropriate (with a period,
    to accomodate styles that use them).

    **Docket Number**: This is the *case number* (not the number of the
    decision itself).

    **Court**: If the name of the deciding body will ordinarily appear
    in Juris-M records as "European Commission." Use the ``Abbreviation
    Filter`` to transform this into the single word ``Commission`` for this
    jurisdiction.

    **Call Number**: This is the number of the decision itself.

    **Date Decided**: The date of the decision may be entered in full;
    only the year will be used when generating citations.

    **Reporter:** Commission decisions are reported in the Official Journal
    of the European Union, L-series. The reporter name can be spelled
    out in full if desired, with an entry in the ``Abbreviation Filter``
    to produce the citation form of ``OJ L``.

    **Issue**: The issue of the ``OJ`` in which the judgment is reported.
    
    **First Page:** The starting page of the judgment in the ``OJ``.

    **Court:** The name of the court. This is set to appear in all
    citations, because some courts (such as ``Bankr.``) should be
    shown. To suppress unwanted court names, use the abbreviation hack
    noted above. In Juris-M, court names are entered from a controlled
    list to assure consistency. Contact the project to request that
    courts be added to the listings.

    **Jurisdiction:** The name of the jurisdiction. In Juris-M this is
    set from a controlled list, and selects this European Union
    citation stylesheet.
