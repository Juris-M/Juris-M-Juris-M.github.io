There as been a development around "Baby Blue's Manual of Legal
Citation" [1] that will force a small update to Juris-M. The update
will come out tomorrow. For now, here is the back-story.

The Bluebook editors have been making nuisances of themselves by
insisting, through legal channels and surrogates, that Professor
Sprigman and Carl Malamud not include the word "Blue" in the title of
their work. It may seem a laughable claim, but it is backed up by an
earnest threat of ruinous litigation in federal court from one of
Boston's finest law firms. Correspondence from this truly Carollian
exercise in unreason is available from the PublicResource project
folder (see especially page 2 of the Ropes & Gray letter of 24
December, and the final PublicResource response in the series, dated
31 March):

    https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/blue/

Hair-splitting over a miniscule fragment of the English language is
irrelevant to the core aim of "Baby Blue": to make the method of
citing laws readily available to people affected by them. Sprigman and
Malamud have sensibly opted to protect their important work from
destruction by changing its title. Sing it:

    "The Indigo Book"

I have updated the Juris-M website to reflect the new title. There is
no substantive change to the guide itself, and it will remain our
standard reference in Juris-M for implementing US citation forms. To
make that amply clear, I have removed references to "Bluebook"
everywhere, and deleted the legacy MLZ style of that name, which no
one should be using anyway.

Changing the style name in desktop clients will be handled
automatically. Tomorrow I will push a fresh Juris-M version that
renames and updates the relevant style file, and removes the old
version. After updating, you will find a "JM Indigo Book Style" in
place of "JM Baby Blue," but apart from the name change, everything
will work exactly as before.

***

I'll close with a few observations of my own on the "Blue Wars." [2]

My own clash with the Bluebook editors (in 2009) was not over
copyright or trademark. I wrote to them about my plan to automate
their style in free software, and possibly to market a book explaining
its use. I requested confirmation that this would be acceptable under
the Terms of Use attached to their website. Their response, confirmed
repeatedly, was that it would not be.

Several people have told me that I should have just gone forward
without contacting the editors---citing as evidence the several
republications of Bluebook rules, including Professor Martin's
excellent guide, [3] that have not raised the slightest controversy.
Asking permission, on this view, was a foolish mistake: do not put
your head in a lion's mouth, and do not ask a lawyer the scope of his
client's rights. I am sure that is sound business advice, but in this
case it is entirely beside the point.

Complex styles like the Bluebook have edge cases. When questions
arise, authors naturally rely on guidance from the style's editors.
This is particularly important when mechanizing a style, because many
users and documents will be affected. Such feedback is a collegial
thing. Or it should be. Strong language in the Terms of Use suggested
that the Bluebook editors might not behave professionally, and leave
me marooned (so to speak); I wrote to them in large part to test the
waters; and I found the waters to be infested with sharks. [4]

There was an immediate cost, in that the forum for posting Bluebook
style queries sits behind the same paywall as the online edition. I
was left to code one of the world's most notoriously difficult styles
without any communication with its editors, and with certain knowledge
of their hostility toward the effort. Was this a strategic error?
Given the ferocious response to Indigo-B n=C3=A9e Baby Blue, I suspect that
I saved myself a load of aggravation by abandoning all thought of
collaboration early on. Given the choice, I would not do anything
differently.

So my second point is that the pointed refusal by the Bluebook's
editors to cooperate was more damaging than any claim to finely
crafted proprietary rights would have been. It belies any intention to
advance the accuracy and efficiency of legal research (assuming that
the 20th edition again makes declarations of that kind). Anyone with
the slightest experience in information technology understands the
wilful refusal to communicate to be a supreme act of hostility,
because it is supremely destructive to the coordination from which
value arises.

To be honest, I have to wonder how long the Bluebook will persist as a
recognized resource. In Juris-M, we have the capacity to accurately
capture citation patterns across multiple domains---not only rules for
the scholarly realm served by the Bluebook, but also rules imposed by
specific courts. It's early days yet, but the repository of
open-access machine-readable citation "knowledge" will grow in due
course to a scope, quality and practical utility that cannot be fully
captured in a single written text. With the right community behind it,
an open project can be nimble enough to explore the possibilities of
building atop such infrastructure. On the other hand, a project
staffed by transient editors, wedded to an antiquated business model,
and mentored by a legal team that values legal claims to the exclusion
of trust...who knows, maybe that works too.

***

Indigo-B has only just come out, but as a public domain work it will
not go away. It would be very good to see a strong editorial process
emerge to maintain it. I believe the groundwork for that is in
progress; if you have thoughts in that line or would like to be
involved in some capacity, Carl Malamud <carl@media.org> may like to
hear from you.

That's it for this evening---update tomorrow!
