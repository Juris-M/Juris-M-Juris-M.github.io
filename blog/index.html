        <h2>Introducing Juris-M: the successor to MLZ</h2>

            Followers of MLZ may have noticed recent mentions of a
            rebranding of the tool as &ldquo;Juris-M.&rdquo;
            This is its home. Welcome: I hope you enjoy the new digs.
            This note explains the reason for the rebranding, introduces
            some of its newly added features, and peeks forward to some
            important developments on the horizon. After reading these
            notes, you can jump to the top of the site by clicking on
            the Juris-M logo at the top of the page.
          </p>
          <h3>Top of the Pops</h3>
          <p>
            Three items stand at the top of the agenda.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Juris-M is a &ldquo;new product&rdquo;</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                Firefox is on the verge of requiring that all Add-ons be
                signed by the author or institution that issues
                them. MLZ began as a (relatively) casual fork of Zotero,
                and it used the same product ID as the official
                product. That was a choice born of inexperience on my
                part, but it will soon be flat-out impermissible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Juris-M has a unique ID all its own, and can be
                distributed under the new policy. One consequence of
                the ID change, however, is that automatic upgrades
                from MLZ to Juris-M will not be possible: you will
                need to manually install Juris-M and its friends from
                the &ldquo;Research Tools&rdquo area of this site.
                After installation, upgrades will be automatic, as
                before.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Juris-M is shy and friendly</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                While Juris-M has a separate identify from Zotero, the
                two are still incompatible
                <i>as software</i>&mdash;that is, it would be
                impossibly confusing to have two full reference
                manager interfaces running in a single browser. As the
                junior partner of the pair, Juris-M will disable
                itself on installation if it detects an enabled Add-on
                with the Zotero ID. If you receive a warning message
                when installing Juris-M, do not be alarmed: just
                disable the old Add-on and re-enable Juris-M, and all
                will be well.
              </p>
              <p>
                If Juris-M finds a Zotero (or MLZ) database in the location
                where installation is requested, it will make a
                <i>separate copy</i> of the existing database, and run
                against that copy. This avoids a long-standing barrier to
                experimenting with the tool. If you install Juris-M, and then
                decide that it is not for you, you can return to your previous
                Zotero installation by re-installing or re-enabling the
                official Zotero Add-on. Juris-M is sync-compatible
                with the official client, so changes made in either client
                can be synced to the other in the usual way.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Juris-M is <i>the</i> successor to MLZ</dt>
            <dd>
              MLZ users should plan to replace it with Juris-M soon,
              for several reasons. First, the new Firefox signing
              policy means that distribution of MLZ will be blocked in
              the near future. Second (and for that reason) MLZ will
              not receive further updates. Finally, there are cool new
              features and bug-fixes in Juris-M already that will make
              your life easier.
