        <h2>Introducing Juris-M: the successor to MLZ</h2>
        <div class="multi-column">
          <p style="background:#eeeeee;border-radius:1.5em;padding:0.5em 1em 0.5em 1em;">
            Followers of MLZ may have noticed recent mentions of a
            rebranding of the tool as &ldquo;Juris-M.&rdquo;
            This is its home: Welcome. I hope you like the new digs.
            This note explains the reason for the rebranding, introduces
            some of its newly added features, and peeks forward to some
            important developments on the horizon. After reading these
            notes, you can jump to the top of the site by clicking on
            the Juris-M logo at the top of the page.
          </p>
          <h3>Top of the Pops</h3>
          <p>
            Three items stand at the top of the agenda.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Juris-M is a &ldquo;new product&rdquo;</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                Firefox is on the verge of requiring that all Add-ons be
                signed by the author or institution that issues
                them. MLZ began as a (relatively) casual fork of Zotero,
                and it used the same product ID as the official
                product. That was a choice born of inexperience on my
                part, but it will soon be flat-out impermissible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Juris-M has a unique ID all its own, and can be
                distributed under the new policy. One consequence of
                the ID change, however, is that automatic upgrades
                from MLZ to Juris-M will not be possible: you will
                need to manually install Juris-M and its friends from
                the &ldquo;Research Tools&rdquo area of this site.
                After installation, upgrades will be automatic, as
                before.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Juris-M is shy and friendly</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                While Juris-M has a separate identify from Zotero, the
                two are still incompatible
                <i>as software</i>&mdash;that is, it would be
                impossibly confusing to have two full reference
                manager interfaces running in a single browser. As the
                junior partner of the pair, Juris-M will disable
                itself on installation if it detects an enabled Add-on
                with the Zotero ID. If you receive a warning message
                when installing Juris-M, do not be alarmed: just
                disable the old Add-on and re-enable Juris-M, and all
                will be well.
              </p>
              <p>
                If Juris-M finds a Zotero (or MLZ) database in the location
                where installation is requested, it will make a
                <i>separate copy</i> of the existing database, and run
                against that copy. This avoids a long-standing barrier to
                experimenting with the tool. If you install Juris-M, and then
                decide that it is not for you, you can return to your previous
                Zotero installation by re-installing or re-enabling the
                official Zotero Add-on. Juris-M is sync-compatible
                with the official client, so changes made in either client
                can be synced to the other in the usual way.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Juris-M is <i>the</i> successor to MLZ</dt>
            <dd>
              MLZ users should plan to replace it with Juris-M soon,
              for several reasons. First, the new Firefox signing
              policy means that distribution of MLZ will be blocked in
              the near future. Second (and for that reason) MLZ will
              not receive further updates. Finally, there are cool new
              features and bug-fixes in Juris-M already that will make
              your life easier.

          <dl>
            <dt>A new moniker!</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                The new name is meant to reflect (a little) that the
                tool supports legal as well as multilingual
                referencing. It also fully separates the name of the
                tool from the Zotero project, since "Zotero" is a
                trademark for the direct work-product of the core team.
                I hasten to add that there has not been any pressure in
                that direction, but the purpose of trademarks is to
                avoid confusion, so rebranding under a completely
                separate name seems a good thing to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can pronounce the new name any way that you like,
                but the obvious choices seem to be either
                &ldquo;juris-em&rdquo; or &ldquo;jurism&rdquo; (as in
                &ldquo;formalism&rdquo;). The &ldquo;j&rdquo; might be
                hard or soft, depending on your own linguistic habits.
                I favour the soft version (&ldquo;yurism&rdquo;),
                because we could then form a project ensemble and call
                it <i>The Juris-M-ics</i>. But I digress.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Modular legal style support</dt>
            <dd>
              Second only the the excitement of the new name is the
              introduction of modular legal style support. You explore
              this through the &ldquo;Style Development&rdquo; area of
              this site, which provides a module-aware previewing
              editor for Juris-M and CSL styles. Legal style modules
              can be maintained independently, and called into action
              by simple template code that can be added to any CSL
              style adapted for use with Juris-M. It is an approach
              that will scale, because it cleanly separates legal
              referencing conventions from the vagaries of
              general-purpose style manuals like the <i>Bluebook</i>.
            </dd>
            <dt>Bug fixes</dt>
            <dd>
              Shortly before this announcement, Juris-M was used to
              proof and format citations in a subset of MA theses in
              our faculty. The process helped us to identify and
              address numerous small bugs and papercuts in the code
              base of the Library Client and the Abbreviation
              Filter, making for a more pleasant user experience.

        <h3>Further developments</h3>
        <div class="multi-column">
          <p>
            There are some challenges in the offing.
          </p>
          <h3>Code review</h3>
          <p>
            The first challenge is related to the code signing
            requirement mentioned above. This will be accompanied by a
            (reputedly relatively loose) form of code review,
            conducted by Firefox contributors or staff. Loose it may
            be, but as I am an amateur coder, and as the volume of
            code that I have written for this Zotero fork is quite
            large, we cannot expect that approval will be easy or
            automatic.  It would be better to have more than one
            person involved in Juris-M coding, but unless and until
            the project has significant funding, I don&rsquo;t expect
            that to happen.
          </p>
          <h3>Sync service</h3>
          <p>
            A second issue involves sync service. Juris-M (like MLZ)
            is currently sync-compatible with official
            Zotero. However, the existing Zotero sync servers will be
            shut down a few months after the release of Zotero 5.0
            (itself due out in a few months&rdquo; time). The main
            project will then move to a new API-based sync
            architecture that is supported by the new Zotero release.
            To retain sync support, Juris-M will need to be adapted to
            the new Zotero 5.0 code base. It is a fairly massive task,
            since the patches applied by Juris-M are numerous, and the
            changes in Zotero are broad and deep. It is proving
            necessary to rewrite significant portions of Juris-M from
            scratch, and it is possible that the API-sync-compatible
            client will not be ready by the time of the shutdown. User
            data will not be at risk, but life could become less
            convenient for a time.
          </p>
          <p style="background:#eeeeee;border-radius:1.5em;padding:0.5em 1em 0.5em 1em;">
            It bears emphasis that neither of the issues above is a
            threat to project survival. Juris-M is in active use among
            students in the faculty where I hold my academic post, and
            that provides ample justification for continuing this
            work&mdash;it is in fact essential to us. Over the longer
            term, we will want to place the project on a firmer
            foundation.  The first step in that direction is likely to
            be a &ldquo;donate&rdquo; button, followed by efforts to
            interest funding bodies and major NGOs to support this
            work, so that we can support the world&ldots;
          </p>
          <p>
            For the present, though, welcome again to Juris-M!
